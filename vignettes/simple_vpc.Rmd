A VPC example using the built in simple_

```{r}
suppressMessages(library(vpc))



```

```{r}
vpc(simple_data$sim, simple_data$obs)


```

Can also easily stratify.

```{r}
vpc(simple_data$sim, simple_data$obs, stratify = c("ISM"))

```

saving as a plot object
```{r}
p <- vpc(simple_data$sim, simple_data$obs, stratify = c("ISM"))


```

Given is a ggplot object can just call the object to print it to the screen
```{r}
p 

```

Can also override with additional theme elements or lines etc
```{r}
p + PKPDmisc::base_theme()

p + geom_vline(xintercept = 3, color = "red")
```
